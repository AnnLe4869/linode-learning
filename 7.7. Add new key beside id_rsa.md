- Description: when we try to run `ssh root@<ip_address>` using public-private key authentication this error happen prevents us from doing authentication

- Context:

  1. We did have a public-private key in `~/.ssh` that has name different from `id_rsa` (for example, our private key file is `id_rsa_do` and public key file is `id_rsa_do.pub`)
  2. We did add the public key into our Linux machine (i.e our Linux did have a `authorized_keys`)
  3. We try to authenticate using public-private key

- Reason: our public-private file, since we use name different from default name `id_rsa` which make it doesn't register with authentication agent. What this means is that when our local machine try to send the private key to Linux machine for authentication, it doesn't send our file `id_rsa_do` since it doesn't know "what these files is for"

  ---> Thus, we need to EXPLICITLY tell the local machine to use those `id_rsa_do` as additional private key beside our default `id_rsa` file

- How to fix: we need to use `ssh-add` command to add that private key file `id_rsa_do` into our authentication agent, and make the agent recognize our file as private key and should send it for authentication. The syntax is `ssh-add <path_to_private_key>`.

  In our case, we need to run

  ```bash
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_do
  ```

## Error: Error connecting to agent: No such file or directory

[StackOverflow on the error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52113738/starting-ssh-agent-on-windows-10-fails-unable-to-start-ssh-agent-service-erro)

- Description: when we try to run `ssh-add` for above step, or just try to run `ssh-add` alone, this error message pop up

- Reason: this happens because we cannot access the agent that manage private keys. This agent is the authentication agent that deal with private key and its passphrase. By default, in Windows, this agent is disabled.

- How to fix:

  1. Check whether this authentication service is working or not by running below command on **Powershell**

     ```powershell
       Get-Service ssh-agent | Select StartType

       StartType
       ---------
       Disabled
     ```

  2. If the agent is disabled, then set up to start the agent manually by running

     ```powershell
     Set-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Manual
     ```

  3. Then we can actually start the agent by running `Start-Service ssh-agent` or just `ssh-agent.exe`

---> Note that these action will require Adminstration authorization on Powershell

## Why doesn't `/ssh` just use all key file inside it instead of making us manually adding those key?

[From the StackOverFlow answer](https://superuser.com/questions/360686/what-exactly-does-ssh-add-do)

> `ssh` does use the key in the `~/.ssh` directory, but if the key is protected by a passphrase, this passphrase must be entered at some point. If you use `ssh-agent` and `ssh-add`, you type this passphrase once. Otherwise you must type the passphrase each time you use ssh. Note that if the key is not password protected, you can use ssh without being asked for a passphrase.
