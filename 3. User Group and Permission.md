# User and Permission

## Root user

---

- This is the highest user, admin role and can do everything
- Not a role that can be assigned to just everyone

## Create user

---

- We have two commands `adduser` and `useradd` which basically do the same things.  
  The different is that `adduser` is built on top of `useradd` and thus some Linux distros doesn't have `adduser`.  
  However, `adduser` is easier to use that `useradd`  
   ----> For our part, we use `adduser`

- To add new user, simply do

  ```bash
  adduser <username-here>
  ```

  It will probably does multiple thing: create a new user, create new group, create home directory, etc.  
  It will also prompt us to enter a password for this user.
  It will also prompt us to enter full name, room, phone, etc. but these are optional

## User - who is the user

---

List of **ALL USERS** are store at `/etc/passwrd`  
 You can view all of these by running

```bash
cat /etc/passwrd
```

We then get a list of users in the format

```bash
username:encrypted_password:user_id_number:user_group_id:user_full_name:user_home_directory:login_shell
```

With these info, the things we interested in are

- `username`: the name of the user
- `user_home_directory`: which is usually the directory `/home/username`
- `login_shell`: by default set to `/bin/bash`

## Sign in as user (other than root user)

---

- To logout from current user, simply run `logout`
- To know the identity of current user, run `whoami`
- To switch to other user use `su` command

  ```bash
  su - other-username
  ```

  This will sign you in as the `other_username` and your start directory would be `/home/<other_username>`

- When you sign in as user other than root, you cannot access the `/root` directory.  
  Note that you can still visit the `/` directory

- To sign in back as root user, simply use the `su` command without any username

  ```bash
  su -
  ```

## Delete user

---

- We can delete a user with either command `deluser` or `userdel`  
  `userdel` is low-level utility command and `deluser` is more friendly to use  
  ---> Thus in our case we use `deluser` to delete a user

- To simply delete a user without removing his files, run the `deluser` without any flag

  ```bash
  deluser username-here
  ```

- To remove the users home directory and mail spool, add `--remove-home` flag
- To remove all files owned by user, add `--remove-all-files` flag
- To backup file before deleting and to target directory that is used as backup, add `--backup` and `--backup-to <directory_name_here>` flag

## Change password

---

Use `passwrd` to change a user password. It will prompt us to enter old password and then ask for the new password

```bash
passwrd <Username>
```

## Group - what is it?

---

- Group is a set of users that has the same permission (for example set of users that has permission to access a Docker file)
- We have **2 types** of group: primary and secondary

  1. **Primary group**: a _unique_ group belong to a user that has the same name as the user. For example a user `my_username` will have a primary group named `my_username`.

     - This primary group is created when the user is created.
     - All the files and directories created by the user will belong to the user's primary group. In our example, those files created by `my_username` belong to the `my_username` group.
     - People that is not in the group `my_username` **CANNOT** read or write to the files in the `my_username` group.
     - A primary group is **NOT EXCLUSIVE** to only the creator of that group. In fact, a primary group is just a group and we can specify a user's primary group when we create that new user or change primary group later (with `usermod`). This mean that other user can join `my_username` group.  
       ----> One user can belong only to _ONE_ primary group

  2. **Secondary group**: one user can belong to multiple secondary group.

- Note that the term primary and secondary is from the user's perspective. A group can be primary to one user while being secondary to the other user

- To find out what groups user belongs to we can use:

  - `groups <username_here>` with the first group is the primary group
  - `id <username_here>` with the primary group is the `gid` part  
    ---> Without adding the username variable, it will use the current user

## Create group

---

Just like before, we have `groupadd` and then `addgroup` but `addgroup` is more friendly to use the the other.  
----> Look like the friendly version have format of `<verb><noun>` whereas the less-friendly version is the reverse

```bash
addgroup <name_of_group>
```

Note that only root user can add a group to system

## Assign and remove a user from a group

---

- To add a user to a group, use `usermod`

  ```bash
  usermod -a -G <group_name_here> <username_here>
  ```

  This will add the user to the group and this group is treated as secondary group for the user.  
  `-a` tag mean append and must be used with `-G` tag which mean group

- To change a user primary group use `-g` tag. Note that this is lowercase

  ```bash
  usermod -g <group_name_here> <username_here>
  ```

- To remove a user from a group, use `gpasswd`

  ```bash
  gpasswd -d <user_name> <group_name>
  ```

## Edit permission

---

- All the group permissions are store at `sudo` file, and to be specific, the file is `/etc/sudoers.tmp`
- To edit this file, run `visudo`  
  This will open the sudo file in Nano

- This `sudo` file is important as it allows user to have privilege access and can have the root authorization.
  Remember the `sudo` command you usually see people put before the command like `sudo apt-get install python`?  
  This `sudo` is a tool that allows users and groups to have access to commands they normally would not be able to use. Since this is very dangerous only user listed in the `sudoers` file can run the `sudo` command, and even then what they can do with this command is limited by the list of what they can do, specify in the `# User privilege specification`

- To edit a certain user permission, edit part in `# User privilege specification` with syntax

  ```bash
  <username>  ALL=<path_to_command_1>,<path_to_command_2>
  ```

  For example

  ```bash
  timmy     ALL=/usr/bin/top, /usr/bin/ls
  ```

  ---> After save the file then the user `timmy` can run the command `/usr/bin/top` or for short, `top` which they cannot run before

- To edit group permission, edit part in `# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command` with syntax

  ```bash
  %<group_name> ALL=<path_to_command_1>,<path_to_command_2>
  ```

  For example

  ```bash
  %bird_hater ALL=/usr/bin/ls, /usr/bin/less, /usr/bin/apt
  ```

  ---> This will allow any user in group `bird_hater` can run command `ls` and `less` and `apt`

## Delete a group

---

Use command `delgroup <group_name>`
