# Shell Script

[Good reading about Shell Script function](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Bash_functions)

## Create a Shell script

- Shell script is **file** that end with `.sh` and contains instruction for Linux machine.  
  We can run these instructions execute some commands for Linux machine (for example `echo` something)
- To create a Shell script file or edit an existing one, run `nano <filename>`

  ```bash
  nano test.sh
  ```

## Shell file "header"

Shell file must have a "header" called Shebang that specify what program will be used to run this Shell script.  
Syntax

```bash
#!path_to_interpreter [optional-arg]
```

For example, if we want to use `bash` run our script (which is what we usually want to do in Linux),

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

In Window, we can use Powershell to run the script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/pwsh
```

## Comment in Shell script

Adding a `#` sign at the beginning of the text will make the rest line after `#` to be a comment and be ignored by the interpreter (similar to Python).  
For example:

```bash
# This is a comment and will be ignored by interpreter
echo "Learn bash" # Print the message onto screen
```

## Execute a Shell script

- First, we need to enable the execute privilege (the `e` in the permission) upon the shell script file.
  We can do so using `chmod` command.

  ```bash
  chmod u+x <filename>
  ```

  Note that if we want other user or group to be able to execute the file do so by modify the `chmod` command slightly.

- To run the shell script, simply type in the file path just like how you run a command.

  ```bash
  ./test.ssh
  ```

## Function in Shell Script

Syntax:

```bash
<function_name>(){
    # Function content
}
```

And to use it, run `<function_name>`. No parenthesis after the function name.  
For example:

```bash
print(){
    echo "Hello"
}
# Run the function
# Note that we only write the function name, not with parenthesis
print
print
print
```

We can pass parameters to the function by writing the values next to the function name while calling it.

```bash
<function_name> <param_1> <param_2>
```

And we access those argument inside our function with `$<number>` where `<number>` is the order of the argument in the list.  
For example:

```bash
fresh(){
   # t stores $1 argument passed to fresh()
   t=$1
   echo "fresh(): \$0 is $0" # Can access the variable value directly
   echo "fresh(): \$1 is $1"
   echo "fresh(): \$t is $t"
   echo "fresh(): total args passed to me $#"
   echo "fresh(): all args (\$@) passed to me -\"$@\""
   echo "fresh(): all args (\$*) passed to me -\"$*\""
}

# invoke the function with "Tomato" argument
echo "**** calling fresh() 1st time ****"
fresh Tomato

# invoke the function with total 3 arguments
echo "**** calling fresh() 2nd time ****"
fresh Tomato Onion Lemon
```

## Variable in Shell Script

Syntax `<variable_name>=<value>`

```bash
x=10
echo $x # Access the variable with $ sign
```

## Exit code

Whenever you have a Linux script or process, when it finishes running, it has a "exit" code. By default, this exit code is **0**.

But it's a good practice in Shell script to **EXPLICITLY** exit the shell to say "Hey this script is done".

To do this, put `exit <exit_code>` at the end of your script file. `exit 0` mean success and `exit 1` mean fail. Think of this as throw error or return in a function.

---> Whenever Linux run into `exit` it will stop the script and return the code to the caller.

## Control flow - if/else

[Good article about control flow syntax](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_wss0080.php)

Syntax

```bash
if [[<commands>]]; then
    <commands>
[elif commands; then
    commands...]
[else
    commands]
fi
```

- Note here that our entire conditional block must start with `if` and end with `fi`.
- The expression to comparison is written inside a double square bracket `[[]]`
- The expression can be checking if file exist, checking if two variable equal each others, etc.

## User input

We can use user's input in the console in out shell script function.

```bash
print(){
    read -d "Please enter your name: " text
    echo "You enter: $text"
}
```

Here we prompt user with `-d` flag, and store the user input into `text` variable
