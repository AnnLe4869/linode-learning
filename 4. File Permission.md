# File permission and chmod

## View permission on a file

---

To view the current user and group permission, do `ls -l` and you will get a list look like this

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 11 10:35 hello
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   95 Jul 11 10:33 tim.txt
```

The first `d` indicates that `hello` is a directory  
If there is no `d` (i.e `-`) then it indicates that `tim.txt` is not a directory

The next set of three characters indicate the **_current user_** permission on the file/directory, in the order of read-write-execute

- `r`: permission to read
- `w`: permission to write
- `x`: permission to execute
- `-`: no permission of this action

  ---> So first 4 character `-rw-` can be interpreted as:

  1. This is not a directory
  2. Can read
  3. Can write
  4. Cannot execute the file

The next set of three character indicate the **_current group_** permission that user is in. Same rule as above.  
 ---> So the 3 characters `r--` can be understood as:

1. Can read
2. Cannot write
3. Cannot execute

The last set of three characters indicate the **_all user existing in the system_** permission.
---> So the 3 characters `r--` can be understood as:

1. Can read
2. Cannot write
3. Cannot execute

## `chmod` to change mode

---

Syntax simplify

```bash
chmod <who> <+/-/=> <permission> <filename>
```

where

- `+` mean granting permission
- `-` mean permission is removed
- `=` mean only those permissions is granted and permissions other than that are revoked

For example

1. ```bash
   chmod u+r,g+x tim.txt
   ```

   ---> This translated as:

   - Current user can read
   - All user of current group can write
   - The target file is `tim.txt`

2. ```bash
   chmod a+w abc.txt
   ```

   ---> This translated as:

   - All user in the system can write
   - The target file is `abc.txt`

3. ```bash
   chmod -R u+w,u+r directory_name
   ```

   ---> This translated as:

   - The current user can read and write
   - The target file is all files and directories inside `directory_name`. The `-R` flag means recursive

4. ```bash
   chmod a-w text.txt
   ```

   ---> This translated as:

   - All user in the system CANNOT write (i.e write permission is revoked)
   - Target is `text.txt`

5. ```bash
    chmod a=w text.txt
   ```

   ---> This translated as:

   - All user in the system can ONLY write and CANNOT read nor execute
   - Target is `text.txt`

6. ```bash
    chmod a=wr abc.txt
   ```

   ---> This translated as:

   - All user in the system can ONLY write and read and CANNOT execute
   - Target is `abc.txt`

7. ```bash
    chmod +x text.txt
   ```

   ---> This translated as:

   - All user in the system can execute
   - Target is `text.txt`

**Note**: without specify the who, Linux will understand that the permission is granted for all users
