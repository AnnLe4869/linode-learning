# Process

Sometimes a program crashes and you need to kill them. Or your machine runs slow.  
 You must find a way to inspect and kill them.  
 Think of it as Panel Control in Window.

## View all running process in the machine with `top`

---

Use command `top` and you will get a table look like so

```bash
PID | USER | PR | NI | VIRT | RES | SHR | S | %CPU | %MEM | TIME+ | COMMAND
```

- `COMMAND` is the process or command that is running (for example systemd is running)
- `TIME` is the amount of time that processing has been running
- `PID` is the process ID of the process that is running. This usually is used to kill the process

## View process with `htop`

---

- Another command that we can used is `htop` and this one is better than `top`.  
  This one is usually installed already, but if not, you can sign in as root user and run `apt install htop` to install that utility
- You have more tools to do like `F3` for search and `F9` to kill a process
- To kill a process, you use `F9`.  
  When do so you will see a list of signal that you choose to send to the process. In Linux to kill a process we send a signal to the process and then this process will interpret the signal and does something with it.  
  ---> For example, a process can do some clean-up before kill itself

  - `9` is `SIGKILL` to Kill signal i.e. kill running process. This is used to cause immediate program termination. It cannot be handled or ignored, and is therefore always fatal.
  - `15` is `SIGTERM` Termination signal

## Kill a process

---

- We can terminate a process with `killall` and `kill`
- `killall` terminates running processes on your system based on name. In contrast, `kill` terminates processes based on Process ID number (PID)

```bash
killall <process_name>
kill <process_pid>
```

## View process running by user

---

- To view the process initiate by the user and not all the process (which include process running by the machine itself), run command `ps`

- By default `ps` list the process run by root user. If you want to see all user process, pass the variable `a`

  ```bash
  ps a
  ```

- To show who is the one running those process, add `u`

  ```bash
  ps au
  ```
