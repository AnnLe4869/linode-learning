# Port

[Good explanation on port](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-computer-port/)

- A port is like a gateway to a machine: one machine can have multiple ports.
  For example, a machine with IP 95.48.32.66 can have multiple ports like port 22, port 80, etc.
- When a request coming to a server, the request must come to a specific port number
- Why we need multiple ports instead of just directing the request to the machine ?
  ---> Well because doing so is very inefficient. Imagine email, file transfer, HTTPS, etc. all go to a same "path" and we have to have separate logic to deal with them (remember, those are of different protocol and not just simple request difference).
  ---> Different ports for different protocol would be better.

- That is why, when develop a server, like Express.js we need to specify which port it will listen to (like port 3000)
- Certain protocol has default port such that when that protocol go to our machine, it will go to that port - Ports 20 and 21: File Transfer Protocol (FTP). FTP is for transferring files between a client and a server.

  - **Port 22**: Secure Shell (SSH). SSH is one of many tunneling protocols that create secure network connections.
  - **Port 25**: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). SMTP is used for email.
  - **Port 53**: Domain Name System (DNS). DNS is an essential process for the modern Internet; it matches human-readable domain names to machine-readable IP addresses, enabling users to load websites and applications without memorizing a long list of IP addresses.
  - **Port 80**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is the protocol that makes the World Wide Web possible.
  - **Port 123**: Network Time Protocol (NTP). NTP allows computer clocks to sync with each other, a process that is essential for encryption.
  - **Port 179**: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP is essential for establishing efficient routes between the large networks that make up the Internet (these large networks are called autonomous systems). Autonomous systems use BGP to broadcast which IP addresses they control.
  - **Port 443**: HTTP Secure (HTTPS). HTTPS is the secure and encrypted version of HTTP. All HTTPS web traffic goes to port 443. Network services that use HTTPS for encryption, such as DNS over HTTPS, also connect at this port.

- There are 65,535 possible port numbers.
- We can set up our machine to block out a certain port number for security reason. For example, for a public web server we want to block **port 22** so that people cannot access our machine directly (imagine someone can access your Linux machine and mess with the file system)
