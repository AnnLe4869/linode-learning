# Networking

## `ifconfig`

Give us info about the configuration of our network interface, i.e, what device connect to our machine OR use to config the network itself

- `eth0` is the first **Ethernet** interface. This list the device that is connected to the network via CABLE
  - `inet` is the IP4 address
  - `inet6` is the IP6 address
- `lo` is the loopback interface. This is a special network interface that the system uses to communicate with itself
- `wlan0` is the name of the first **wireless** network interface on the system

## `ip`

A simplified version of `ifconfig` that will give is the IP address and other info

To get the IP address, run `ip -4 addr`

## `netstat`

Used to listen to network activity. For example, which port is open, which port connect to what,etc.

## `curl`

- Used to test out end point or send a request. Think of it as a way to "browse" the internet
- By default, without any flag it will just do a GET request to the end point and display whatever it receive

  ```bash
  curl https://google.com
  ```

  ---> This will display a whole HTML text since this is what we normally receive when we make a request to a website (browser is the one that parse that HTML)

- To specify the method, use flag `-X`

  - For POST and PUT request, to send data we specify key-value with flag `--data`

    ```bash
    curl -X POST --data "parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2&parameter3=value3" <URL_endpoint>
    ```

    Or we can use flag `-d`

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -d parameter1=value1 -d parameter2=value2 -d parameter3=value3 <URL_endpoint>
    ```

  - For DELETE request only `-X` with DELETE is enough

- To do request and store the returned data into a file, use `-o` flag

  ```bash
  curl -o <filename_here> <URL_endpoint>
  ```

- To read the HEADER content of a response, use `-I` flag

  ```bash
  curl -I <URL_endpoint>
  ```

- To send the HEADER together with a request, use `--header` flag

  ```bash
  curl --header "HEADER content here" -X POST -d param=value <URL_endpoint>
  ```

  For example

  ```bash
  curl --header "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d name=john https://myname.com
  ```

## `ping`

Use to check if an endpoint is active and checking if we getting a response from it. It does so by sending package to the endpoint and listen the response.

`ping` send package continuously and only stop if we do `Ctrl+C`

`ping` only check of the endpoint can be connected or not. It doesn't check whether we actually get any real value back (for example, in web development, 404 is still considered to be reachable)
---> `ping` only fail when the server basically "dead", for example, server doesn't connect to network, etc.
