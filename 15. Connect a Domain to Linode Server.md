# Connect Domain to Server

## Run the server even when the window is closed

---

[Reading on `screen` - background running](https://www.howtogeek.com/662422/how-to-use-linuxs-screen-command/)

- Right now we run the Gunicorn session on local machine and if we close the session window (close the SSH window), the Gunicorn will stop and the website stop working.  
   ---> If we visit the website now we will see a 502 Bad Gateway since we can still connect to Nginx but Nginx connect to nothing
  ---> Need to detach the process from SSH Window

- Prefix the `screen` command before the commands we want to run will detach that commands from current window and thus still running even when we close the current window. For example

  ```bash
  screen gunicorn -w 3 our_flask_project:app
  ```

  ---> Our gunicorn will still run even when we close the session (compare to before where the whole things stop when we close the session)

What this does is that it run the command in the background of the **Linux machine** and not on the session, thus session close doesn't affect it operation.

## Buy a Domain

---

- Any domain provider like NameCheap, GoogleDomain, etc.

- In the NameServer parts, enter the Linode name servers, which are

  - ns1.linode.com
  - ns2.linode.com
  - ns3.linode.com
  - ns4.linode.com
  - ns5.linode.com

- Go to Linode dashboard, and hit create domain. Enter the domain name that we purchased. The email can be anything (not need to be the same email used for the domain purchase)

- Choose to insert default record and choose the linode we want to link to (i.e which Linux machine we want to link to this domain)
