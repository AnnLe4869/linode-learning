# Environment variables

## What it is?

---

- Environment variables are variables that are specific for a environment
- Why we need? Because sometimes we have value like API Token, password, etc that we don't want to share to other and we want those value limited only to our machine

## `env` - show all current environment variable

---

- The environment variables go as key-value pairs.
- If we run command `env` we will see list of environment variables that look like:

  ```bash
  HOME=/root
  SSH_CLIENT=98.176.202.131 51786 22
  ```

- To print a specific environment variable use `printenv`

  ```bash
  printenv SSH_CLIENT
  ```

- To access an environment variable from a **shell script** we use `$<variable_name>`.  
  For example, `$SSH_CLIENT`.  
  Another example, `echo $SSH_CLIENT`

## Create new environment variable for CURRENT USER

---

- Use `export` command will create a **TEMPORARY** environment variable that live only in the current session.

  ```bash
  export VAR=test
  ```

  ---> Now we have the environment variable `VAR` with value of `test`.

  Note that this environment variable live only in this session, which means that if we close the current session (i.e close the current bash window), this variable will disappear.

- To create a **persisting variable**, i.e the one that stay even in the new session, we need to write that variable in the "environment variable file".
- Persisting environment variable are written in the `.bashrc` file that located in the root (i.e `~` or `/root/.bashrc`).
  To open this file, run `nano .bashrc`.
- At any point in the file, we can define our environment variable here as followed:

  ```bash
  export <OUR_VARIABLE>=<value>
  ```

  For example,

  ```bash
  export MY_NAME=JOSH
  ```

  ---> **No space** between variable name and value. Also if we want to have space in our value, out the value in quotation mark.

  ```bash
  export MY_NAME="john doe"
  ```

- Save the file, and the list of environment variable will be updated **NEXT SESSION**
- For the change to take place immediately, need to run `source .bashrc`.

**NOTES**: this environment variable defined in `.bashrc` applied only for CURRENT USER. Other user won't see it.

## Change value of environment variable

---

The `export` command can be used to change an existing environment variable.

```bash
export <EXISTING_VARIABLE>=<value>
```

Note that this will only apply **TEMPORARILY** and the next session, the variable will revert back to the old value. If we want the value to be persisted, you need to change the value in the `.bashrc` file

## Create global environment variable (every user can use it)

---

- We first need to have access to `/etc` directory and the `environment` file inside it (`/etc/environment`)
- We edit the `environment` file with any editor. For example `nano /etc/environment`
- We just like above, write our variable here with syntax

  ```bash
  export <OUR_VARIABLE>=<value>
  ```

  Now our `environment` file would look something like this

  ```bash
  PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin"

  export MY_MACHINE_NAME="invincible linux"
  export AGE=15
  ```

- Next thing we do is updated the `.bashrc` with command `source /etc/environment`

## Delete environment variable

---

- For temporary environment variable (the one that will be gone when we exit the session), we use `unset` command

  ```bash
  unset <VARIABLE_NAME>
  ```

  Note that this WON'T remove the variable in `.bashrc` or `/etc/environment` files
