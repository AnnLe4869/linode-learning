# `.ssh` directory location

- In both local and Linux machine, in both Windows and MacOS, the **DIRECTORY** is stored at `~/`, mean that it's stored right where you start when you successfully sign in.
- The `.ssh` is a **DIRECTORY** that has keys file inside it.
- Each user can has their own `.ssh` directory. For example, user `root` has its own `.ssh` store under `/root` whereas user `john` has his `.ssh` stored under `/home/john`.

  ---> This is understandable as the ssh used to authenticated each user is different, thus the key must be separated for each individual user.

- The file that store public key is `authorized_keys`
- There can be multiple public key in `authorized_keys` as the [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47771263/multiple-ssh-keys-for-same-user-on-same-host)
