## `|` pipe

---

This "pipe" character chains commands together. It takes the output from one command and feeds it to the next as input. For example,

```bash
cat words.txt | grep [cC]
```

What this file does is

1. `cat` read the content of `words.txt` and pass this content into `grep`
2. `grep` the filter out only the matched pattern.

---> Print out lines in the file `words.txt` that match the pattern `[cC]`

Another example is

```bash
ls | grep LH
```

What this file does is

1. `ls` list all files in the current directory and pass this list into `grep`
2. `grep` the filter out only the matched pattern. In out case, only file that have character `LH` in it.
