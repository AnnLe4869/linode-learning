# What are those above ?

- **DNS** or Domain Name System is the system that store the domain name. You can understand it as the name, like "google.com"

- **Name Server** is the name that point to the web provider service that we use to host our site (like AWS, Linode, Digital Ocean, etc.) and it looks somethings like "ns1.linode.com"

- **DNS Record** is a record that contains our own server IP address (the IP address that point to our Linux machine)

---> So when we search for a name "google.com" such things happen in order:

1. Browser use the _name from search bar_ and DNS to retrieve _name server_
2. Browser ask _name server_ for the _DNS Record_ which contains our actual IP address
3. Browser use our IP address to go to our website
