# Linode

## Introduction

- Linode is a VPS, which basically mean that Linode rent us a computer, a virtual one.
- In this computer we can set up all things we want: we can install all software we need to make it a server, or use it as a normal storage, etc. Think of it just like a normal computer.
- Unlike AWS or Google Cloud, we have to set up everything on our own to make it work. Just like normal computer need to set up before we can use it.

## Start a Project

- Create Linode will create a Linux machine. Here we select how much CPU, RAM, Storage, etc.
- Volume add additional storage for us to use (for example 20 GB)
- NodeBalancer us used to balance our server in case a lot of request coming in - it distribute the load evenly between machine
- Marketplace is plugins store where we can find the software to install for easy deploy our app.
  For example, if we have a LAMP app there is a plugin to do so.
- Some other services likes Firewall to control access, Domain to manage DNS record, etc.

## Create a Linode

- Select Create and choose Linode.
- Choose distribution (i.e what OS), region, CPU, Storage, etc.
- Take notice of the IP address and the root password
- Connect to the machine using `ssh` command as followed: `ssh root@<IP Address here>`
  It will prompt user to enter root password
- If the password is correct, the user is now connect to the machine
- Update the machine by running `sudo apt update`
- Upgrade the machine by running `sudo apt upgrade`

## SSH - what is it?

- A protocol (same type as HTTPS) for securely communicating between machine.
- Typical applications include remote command-line, login, remote command execution
- SSH is generally used to access Linux server
- SSH allow safely communication by encrypt the message between computers using **public-key cryptography**
- **public-key cryptography** mean that there is a public key that everyone know about and a private key only the owner know. The sender use the public key to encrypt the message and the receiver will use his private key to decrypt the encrypted message. Only the matching private key can be used to decrypt the encrypted message
