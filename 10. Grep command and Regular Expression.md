# Grep command and Regular Expression

## `grep` - Search text pattern using expression

---

- `grep` is used to search for a text pattern in a file, search for files from its name or even search for file from its content. The syntax is:

  ```bash
  grep <pattern> <filename>
  ```

  where `<patter>` is the pattern we want to search for.

  ---> This will show us **all the lines** that contains text that match the pattern

- The `<pattern>` is regular expression and we use that to create the pattern to search.  
  Usually when you write regular expression you put the expression in quotation mark `""` since the notation of expression can mess up the command syntax.

  ```bash
  grep "[A,B]{1,5}.[1-9]" text.txt
  ```

## `grep` options

---

- `-n` will show the line number of the matched line.
- `-o` will show only the part the match the pattern.
- `-i` will ignore case
- `-r` will search recursively. What it means is that it will search for all files in a directory.

  ```bash
  grep -r <directory_name> <pattern>
  ```

  ---> This will list all the files together with the text inside it that match the pattern
