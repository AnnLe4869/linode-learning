# Advanced command

- `uptime` show the uptime of the system.

  ```bash
  uptime
  ```

  ---> We will see the total time the system have been running, how many user in the system

- `wall` allows communication between different users on the same Linux machine. For example, you are admin and you want to broadcast message to all other users that are logged in. Syntax"

  ```bash
  wall <message>
  ```

  ---> This, however, broadcast message to **ALL USERS** and we cannot specify who will or will not receive the message. If we want to specify who will receive the message, use `write`

- `write` allows sending message to specific user (only one user at a time).

  ```bash
  write <username>
  ```

  ---> This will open up a console that will display our message in real time to the `<username>`. Think of it like real-time message

  For example

  ```bash
  write timmy
  hi timmy
  how are you today
  are you good
  ```

  ---> User `timmy` will receive message all those message and only stop when the sender hit `Ctrl+C`

  Note that since `write` will take over the console of the receiver, as a receiver you sometimes want to disable the ability to receive message (and thus won't be "taken over" by the sender). To do so use `msg` command

- `msg` to enable or disable the ability to receive message. Syntax

  ```bash
  msg <y/n>
  ```

  ---> `y` will enable receiving while `n` will disable it. For example

  ```bash
  msg y # Enable receiving message, and the console may potentially be taken over when receiving message
  msg n # Disable receiving message
  ```

- `who` will show all users that are logged in the system. Note that only the users that are **currently** logged in are showed.

  ```bash
  who
  ```

- `free` will show all the system resource (memory, swap, etc.)

- `sort` is used to arrange lines in a **file** in certain order

- `shutdown` is used to shut down the Linux machine at a specified time from the command line. Syntax

  ```bash
  shutdown <option ...> <time>
  ```

  - `<option>` is the flag which describe what do you want to do:
    - `-H` is halt
    - `-P` or `-h` is power off
    - `-r` is reboot
  - `<time>` is the time in which the machine shall shut down or amount of time from now that the machine should shut down.
    - Syntax for "precise time to shut down" is in `hh:mm` format
    - Syntax for "time until the shutdown" is `+m` were `m` is in minutes

  For example,

  ```bash
  shutdown -h +10 # Power off the machine 10 minutes from now
  shutdown -r 15:30 # Power off the machine at 15:30
  ```

- `man` brings up the detail of other detail. Syntax: `man <command>`

- `whatis` the short description of `man`

- `tail` show the last specified number of lines of a **file**. By default it shows last 10 lines of the file.

  ```bash
  tail hello.txt
  tail -n 50 hello.txt # -n tag to specify how many lines to display
  ```
