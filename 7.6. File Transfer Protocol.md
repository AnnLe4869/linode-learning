# File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

- A standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network.
- Basically what it means is, it allows us to transfer file back and forth between our local machine and our Linux machine easily. Think of it as moving file between folders.
- FTP is not designed to be a secure protocol, and has many security weaknesses. FTP does not encrypt its traffic; all transmissions are in clear text, and usernames, passwords, commands and data can be read by anyone able to perform packet capture (sniffing) on the network.
- FTP can be used with CLI only ( for example with `ftp` command) or with GUI. In our case we can use **FTP Client** and some good ones are FileZilla, WinSCP, etc.

## Secure FTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol (`sftp`)

- Since FTP is unsecured and should only be used to move files around within the network, if we want to move files around via internet, you should use SSH File Transfer Protocol

## FTP Client

- The GUI is different depending on the software, but the core is similar: you enter the Linux machine IP address, the username and the password. Then you will have 2 windows open show files: one for local machine and one for the Linux machine.
- We can set up the option for public-private key. Usually you can find this in `Settings`
- Some software like WinSCP default use SSH File Transfer Protocol over plain FTP - which is a good thing as it encrypts our files when transferring back and forth between local and host machine
