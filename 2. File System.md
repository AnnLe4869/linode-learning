# Structure

- When we start the terminal the location we are at is `/root`.  
  This indicates that we are the root user.  
  The directory `/root` is **NOT** top-most directory.

- The `~` indicate that we are at `/root` directory. This is the unique indication of root directory.
- The top-most directory is `/`.
  Note that `/root` and `/` are different.
- Underneath the `/` directory are directories we can work with like `/home`, `/lib`, `/var`, etc.
- `/bin` contains user-executable files, essential for system to function properly
- `/lib` contains libraries required by those in `/bin`
- `/boot` contains files required to boot the OS
- `/dev` contains files that has info about our hardware
- `/etc` contains info about our host specific system config
- `/home` contains all files of users. For example if we have a `user1` then the files of `user1` will be stored in `/home/user` (like videos, images, etc.)
- `/usr` file shared by all users and everyone can look at it but read-only

## Basic commands: `ls`, `cd` and `pwd`

---

- `ls` is used to list files and directories under the current directory. Some good to remember tags:

  - `-a`: list all directories and files (by default file start with `.<filename>` won't be listed )
  - `-l`: long list format, which mean give us more detail about the directory/file
  - `-h`: list the file/directory in human-readable format

- `cd` is used to move around directories. Some quick moves:
  - `cd ~`: move to `/root` directory
  - `cd /`: move to `/` directory
  - `cd .`: move to current directory (used to traverse to directories that are under the current directory)
  - `cd ..`: move up to parent directory

## Create new directory `mkdir`

---

- Used to create directory at the current location

  ```bash
  mkdir my-new-directory
  ```

- We can also use this command to create nested directory

## Create file and read simple file with `touch` and `cat`

---

- `touch` is used to create file at the current location

  ```bash
  touch my-new-file
  ```

- `cat` is used to read the file content.

  ```bash
  cat my-existing-file
  ```

  Note that if we can use `cat` to open multiple files, append files into another

  ```bash
  cat file-we-want-to-add-to >> file-we-want-to-be-added
  ```

  Or we can concatenate multiple files into new file

  ```bash
  cat file1 file2 > combine-file
  ```

## Move and copy with `mv` and `cp`

---

- Move file with `mv`.  
  Note that the location we want to move to has to be correct otherwise we may risk change the file name.

  Yes the `mv` command can be used to **RENAME** the file

  ```bash
  mv our-file ./our-directory/nested-directory
  ```

  We can do this operation on multiple files at once

  ```bash
  mv 1-file 2-file ./our-directory/nested-directory
  ```

- Copy file with `cp`

  ```bash
  cp original-file copy-file
  ```

## Remove directory and file with `rm`

- To delete a file, no flag is needed

  ```bash
  rm file-to-delete
  ```

- To delete a directory that is **blank** (no content inside), need flag `-d`

  ```bash
  rm -d our-directory
  ```

- To delete a directory that has content inside it (i.e it has some files or nested directories), need to have `-r` tag

  ```bash
  rm -r our-directory-with-content
  ```

## Multiple files manipulation

---

We can manipulate multiple files as one if we write the file name in pattern form

```bash
rm *.txt
```

This will remove all the `.txt` file currently that is existing in the current location

## Search for file with `find`

---

Search using the given expression that is inside our current directory

```bash
find . -name tim.txt
```

We first provide the **area** we would like to search in (in our case it is within our current directory `.`), search using the file name `tim.txt`

Note that the name must be the exact match when using `-name` flag
