# Install package

We use `apt` command to install a package

```bash
apt install python
```

Note that `apt` is short for Advanced Package Tool, is a software that is user to handle the installation and removal of software.

Note that `apt` is a more updated version of `apt-get` and `apt-cache`.

Usually you will see people run `apt-get` instead of `apt`

```bash
apt-get install python
```
