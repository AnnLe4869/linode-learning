- Syntax `vim <filename>`
- To start writing into the file, type `I` which stands for Insert mode.
- To highlight, copy, cut and paste, type `V` which stand for Visual mode. This is where we can do think like search for text, move around very fast, delete word fast, etc.
- To get back to normal mode, hit `Esc`.
- To get to command mode -i.e where we execute things like save files or exit, must be in normal mode and do `:<command>`.  
  For example, to quit and save, run `:wq`

- To copy a part of text, first start the visual mode with `V`.  
  Then highlight all the text you want to copy.  
  Then hit `Y` for copy or `D` for delete (not cut)
  Then move on to location you want to paste and hit `P`
- To delete one word hit `D`
- To undo hit `U`
- To redo hit `Ctrl+R`
- To move forward one word `W` and back with `V`
- Start of line `0` and end of line `Shift+4`
