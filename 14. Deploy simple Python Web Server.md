# Deploy a Python web server

## Install Python and Pip (for package management)

To install Python, run `apt install python3`
To install pip, run `apt install python3-pip`

Note that before you install the package, check to see whether you already have it installed or not. If you already have those packages installed, trying to re-install it again my cause some error messages to pop up. Just follow the error instruction.

## Create Flask server

- Create a directory for your server by running `mkdir <directory_name>`
- Create Python file that store the website. The file name shall be `__init__.py` because it's Flask app
- Install all necessary package with `pip3 install <python_package_only>`.  
  If you have a `requirements.txt` file you can run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all packages

## Install and Config Nginx

- Nginx is a software for **web serving** with the role of handling request that coming to the _public IP address of the Linux machine_ and forward those requests to our Flask server. It handles things like load balancing and cache.
  ---> Act as a gateway between exterior request and our Flask server.
  ---> It is a **SERVER** that have to run side by side with our actual app, and act as middleman. When a request coming in to our IP address, it will go to the nginx first, then nginx will redirect the request to our Flask app.

- How Nginx know which local server to redirect the request to? By reading the config file we set up.

- To install Nginx run `apt install nginx`

- To create Nginx config file, run `touch /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/<directory_name_of_flask_app>` to create the config file. Note that the path and the name of directory to our Flask app must be correct in order for nginx to find the config files.  
  On one note, we can create and edit the file by running the `nano` command instead of just `touch` command

- To write the config file, follow the instruction in Nginx of [how to set up the config file](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html#conf_structure). For now, just follow the tutorial.

- Next, we need to unlink the default config as we want to use the config we just set up above. Run the command

  ```bash
  unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
  ```

- Then we need to reload the nginx to load the new config by running `nginx -s reload`

## Install Gunicorn

[More about Web Server Gateway Interface](https://www.fullstackpython.com/wsgi-servers.html)

Gunicorn is a Web Server Gateway Interface. It is used to forward requests **from a web server** (such as Apache or NGINX) to a **backend Python web application** or framework. From there, responses are then passed back to the webserver to reply to the requestor

---> In short, Gunicorn is needed to link our Flask app to Nginx. Gunicorn is also the one that **ACTUALLY** run our app (python app way of running is different from, let say, nodejs) and it helps the Python server run more responsive

## Start the server - now we can actually handle external request

[Document about Gunicorn command syntax](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/run.html)

- Go to the parent of the directory where we create the app (i.e the parent of the directory where the `__init__.py` locates).
  ---> If we run `ls` now we should see our directory `<directory_name_of_flask_app>`

- Run command

  ```bash
  gunicorn -w <worker> <directory_name_of_flask_app>:<flask_instance>
  ```

  where `-w <worker>` is he number of worker processes. This number should generally be between 2-4 workers per core in the server

  For example, in our case

  ```bash
    gunicorn -w 3 our_flask_project:app
  ```

  ---> This means our app will run on 3 workers, the folder is `our_flask_project` and the flask instance (i.e the variable we defines as `Flask(__name__)`) is `app`

- Now we can visit the app when we go to the public IP of the Linux machine (i.e the one that show on the Linode dashboard as IP address)
