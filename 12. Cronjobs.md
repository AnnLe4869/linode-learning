# Cron jobs

[Good Wiki page to read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)

Basically it is a way for us to schedule tasks to run on specific time. For example, we have some task that we don't want to run immediately, we can schedule it to run, let say, 10 hours from now or at 2021/12/24 at 3:00 AM

---> `cron` is the software utility you want that work well with repetitive task. For one-time task, take a look at `at` utility

## Crontab vs Cronjob

- **Crontab** is a manager for cronjob and specific for each user. Each user on the system has only one crontab. In short, crontab is a **file** that has a list of cronjob that will be scheduled to run.
- **Cronjob** is a command that is scheduled to run at specific time and is managed by crontab

- To view all current cronjob run `crontab -l`
- To create a crontab we run `crontab -e`. The `-e` flag mean edit, so if user already has the crontab ready, it will edit that crontab, and if not, will create a new one. It will then ask for what editor used to open and edit the crontab (remember crontab is just a file that list out the cronjobs)

## Create a cronjob

The syntax for a cronjob is:

```bash
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday;
│ │ │ │ │                                   7 is also Sunday on some systems)
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * * <command to execute>
```

We specify the time in which the command will run. `*` mean that command will run on each occurrence.

For example:

```bash
1 * * * * echo "Hello  world"
```

---> This will run at the first minute of every hours. (i.e 1:01, 2:01, 3:01, ..., 24:01)

```bash
45 23 * * 6 echo "Hello  world"
```

---> This will run at 23:45 (11:45 PM) every Saturday

It is also possible to specify `*/n` to run for every n-th interval of time.

```bash
*/5 1,2,3 * * * echo "hello world"
```

---> This will run every 5th minute of every first, second and third hour (i.e., 01:00, 01:05, 01:10, up until 03:55).

We can specify multiple specific time intervals can be done with commas (e.g., 1,2,3).

```bash
5,10,15 * * * * echo "hello world"
```

---> This will run at 5th, 10th and 15th minute of each hour(i.e 0:05, 0:10, 0:15, 1:05, 1:10, 1:15, ...)
