# SSH - what is it?

- A protocol (same type as HTTPS) for securely communicating between machine.
- Typical applications include remote command-line, login, remote command execution
- SSH is generally used to access Linux server
- SSH allow safely communication by encrypt the message between computers using **public-key cryptography**
- **public-key cryptography** mean that there is a public key that everyone know about and a private key only the owner know. The sender use the public key to encrypt the message and the receiver will use his private key to decrypt the encrypted message. Only the matching private key can be used to decrypt the encrypted message
- There are multiple algorithm to create the public-private key.
  Some secure ones are **RSA** and **EdDSA**
