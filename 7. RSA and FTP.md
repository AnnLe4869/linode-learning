# RSA and FTP

## RSA - Public and Private key Authentication

- This help us avoid typing the user password every time we try to connect to the server
- Public key is stored on server and private key is stored on local machine
- After setting this up, later when we try to access the Linux machine, we only need to pass this private key to our machine (in fact, we don't need to do this as our OS will automatically does this for us). The Linux machine then will **compare this private key with the public key** stored on the Linux machine and if it's matched, the Linux machine will authenticate us
- This is safer than using password as password is susceptible to brute force attack.
- After we enable the public-private key we can disable the password authentication to help secure the machine from brute force attack.
- Note that **RSA** is the algorithm to generate such public-private key. Don't be confused with SSH which is a protocol for encrypted communication which also use public-private key to encrypt message.

## Generate RSA with MacOS/another Linux machine

- This can also work with Windows if we use PowerShell and the command is similar. Just like Linux, the user root directory is `/Users/<username>`, and so `~` is equivalent to, for example `/Users/johnson`.  
   ---> In our `/Users/<username>` we also have a `.ssh` folder

- First we need to check whether the private key already exist on our local machine since we don't want to override it.

  ```bash
  ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa*
  ```

  If you see the following files appear, **DO NOT** do the following steps

  ```bash
  /Users/<username_here>/.ssh/id_rsa
  /User/<username_here>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```

  The reason is that the next step will generate these 2 files and if these 2 already exist it will override these.

- If those 2 files above don't exist, we can generate those files

  ```bash
    ssh-keygen -b 4096
  ```

  `-b` flag is used to specify the ket size and `4096` is the key size. We can specify the algorithm with `-t` flag

- This will then prompt us to enter a **passphrase**. **Passphrase** is different from password. What passphrase does is it will decrypt our key when the key is sent to Linux server. This will help secure our key in case someone has access to our local machine, they won't be able to copy your private key. The downside to passphrases is that you need to enter it every time you create a connection using SSH.

- If you already has the public-private key (i.e `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` already exist), you can use those key files. Again those a just the public-private key file - just a string used as key, thus can be re-used without any problem.

- If we want to specify the file name and location of public-private key file location (if we don't want the default location `/Users/<username_here>/.ssh`) we can use `-f` flag to specify the location.

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -f <path_to_location>/<file_name>
  ```

  For example

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -f /root/tutorial-key/my-key
  ```

  ---> In oue example, the private key file is `my-key` (no extension) and the public key file is `my-key.pub`. They are stored at `/root/tutorial-key` dictionary

## Add key pair to our Linux machine - MacOS and Linux

- After creating the private-public key, we can save those key to the Linux machine we want to connect to using `ssh-copy-id` with syntax. We run this on our local machine without needing to log in to our Linux machine. Note that this command **DOES NOT EXIST** on Windows, thus we need to use different method when working with Window

  ```bash
  ssh-copy-id <username>@<server_ip_address>
  ```

  For example

  ```bash
  ssh-copy-id root@45.79.91.28
  ```

  Or

  ```bash
  ssh-copy-id timmy@45.79.91.28
  ```

  ---> This will ask you to enter the password for the user you want to use this public-private key on.

  After we have done it, we can test it out. Run `ssh root@45.79.91.28` and we should be authenticated without entering any password and can access to our Linux machine.

  Note that if we did choose a passphrase before when we created the public-private key, we will be prompt to enter it here.

- Only after you verify that this private-public key authentication work do we disable Password-based SSH Authentication. This is optional and do this only if you worry about security.

  1. Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file with nano, vim, etc

     ```bash
     nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```

  2. Find the line in the file that includes `PasswordAuthentication`, make sure it is NOT commented out with `#` at the start and change it to `no`

     ```bash
     PasswordAuthentication no
     ```

  3. Save the file and you should be good to go

## Add key pair to our Linux machine - Windows

[Lesson link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPZSkEagn68&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-nUIIMsz040W_X-03QH5c5h&index=8)

1. Install PuTTYGen from [official website](https://www.puttygen.com/download-putty). Choose to download the `puttygen.exe` 64-bit
2. After finishing download the program, run it. You will see a GUI appear. We will generate the public-private key from this GUI (this is the complete program).
3. Select the algorithm to generate key. In our case select RSA
4. Adjust the number of bits of our key. We choose 4096 bit to increase the length of our key
5. Click `Generate`. This will prompt us to move our mouse around as our mouse location is input for the key generation algorithm.
6. Enter key passphrase (optional)
7. After the key is generate, we need to manually save both public and private key. Click the `Save Pubic Key` and `Save Private Key` respectively.
8. We can name our file however we want, wherever we want. Just remember that the public key file extension must be `.txt` and private key file extension must be `.ppk`
9. Install PuTTY from [official website](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) and choose the 64-bit x86. After that start the PuTTY program, and in the GUI enter our Linux IP address to the `Host name`. We can save this config by typing the name in `Saved Session` so that we don't need to enter the IP address later. Watch [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebHX9c75H8I&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-nUIIMsz040W_X-03QH5c5h&index=1). Note that Ctrl+V won't paste here.
10. In the session, select `Connection ---> SSH ---> Auth` then browse `Private key file for authentication`. Find the private key file we created before. Load it. Note to save this key to our session (we have to load the session first, then save the private key)
11. Then we open the PuTTY terminal. First attempt we will see our key is refused. This is understandable since we didn't load our public key to the Linux machine.
12. After we successfully authenticated with password, we need to check whether the `.ssh` directory already existed in current user directory (for root user current directory `~` is `/root` while for user john the current directory `~` is `/home/john`). If this directory hasn't exist, create it by running `mkdir .ssh`
13. Navigate to the `.ssh` directory and create a **FILE** named `authorized_keys` by running `touch authorized_keys` only if the file didn't exist.
14. After that, move out to root directory by running `cd ..`
15. Now we need to set up the permission to read the directory `.ssh` and file by running sets of command below

    ```bash
    chmod a+rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx .ssh
    cd .ssh
    chmod a+rwx,u-x,g-rwx,o-rwx authorized_keys
    ```

    ---> What it does is it allows current user to read, write and execute the `.ssh` directory and others cannot do anything, and for `authorized_keys` file, the current user only allowed to execute it and others people cannot do anything.

    ---> Only does step 15 if the folder `.ssh` didn't exist before

16. Write the **public key** into the `authorized_keys`. We can use `vim` or `nano` to write into the file. At the start of the key, write ssh-rsa like so `ssh-rsa <public_key_here>`.  
    Note that only copy the key and not the comments on the public key file and when paste we must delete all escape characters and must in one line.

## Add key pair to our Linux machine - Windows (Short way)

[StackOverflow answer](https://serverfault.com/questions/224810/is-there-an-equivalent-to-ssh-copy-id-for-windows)

- If the `.ssh` is already exist on the Linux machine, run

  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <username>@<host_ip_address> "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
  ```

- If the `.ssh` doesn't exist on the Linux machine, run

  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <username>@<host_ip_address> "mkdir ~/.ssh; cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
  ```

  - `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is the path to our public key file. If our public key file is of different location, simply change part to the correct location.
  - `cat` can be used to copy, which is what we do as we want to copy the public key file from our local machine.
  - Then the second `cat` is used to **append** to our `authorized_keys` file
