# Network and IP

- Within one network, the IP for each machine must be unique and all machines must have its own IP address
- One machine can join 2 or more networks at the same time
- One machine can have different IP addresses on different networks.  
  For example machine A can have IP of 123ABC on network 1 and IP of 456DEF on network 2

- Multiple interfaces === multiple addresses (mean that there are multiple networks)

- Each computer will have a special network called **loopback interface**.  
  This is the internal interface that happen ONLY within the computer.  
  Think of it as a way for different part of the machine talk to each other.  
  By default, the loopback interface address is **127.0.0.1** and its name is _localhost_
