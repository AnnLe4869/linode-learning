# Nginx

- After you install Nginx with `apt install nginx` the nginx **AUTOMATICALLY** start running. At this point we can actually use the browser and visit our Linux IP address and we will see the default response page of Nginx

- We can check the Nginx running status with `service nginx status`

- The Nginx server can be stop and re-start, though you usually don't need to do so.

- However you will need to reload the Nginx configuration file if we change the config in using `nginx -s reload`.

- To write the config file (which is used to specify which local file Nginx should re-direct request to), visit [Beginner guide](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html#static) or [Tim Guide for simple Flask server](https://github.com/techwithtim/Flask-App-Hosted-On-VPS#install-and-configure-nginx)

- To restart a Nginx server, run `/etc/init.d/nginx restart` or `service nginx restart` as per [StackOverflow answer](https://serverfault.com/questions/213185/how-to-restart-nginx)
